### Project Description
Sleep encouragement Alarm

Wake Me Not is a playful reverse alarm that reminds you to sleep instead of waking you up. At a set time, it plays a sound and displays sarcastic or encouraging messages like ‚ÄúStill awake? Go to bed.‚Äù Though technically simple, it‚Äôs a fun and useless project that humorously promotes better sleep habits.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
People are way too committed to staying up late‚Äîbinge-watching, doom-scrolling, or pretending to study. Clearly, what the world desperately needs is an alarm that doesn‚Äôt wake you up, but instead begs you to sleep. Because your self-control won‚Äôt... maybe a sarcastic beep will.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing Wake Me Not ‚Äî an alarm that does the bare minimum to get you to sleep. At your chosen bedtime, it plays a dramatic sound and flashes messages like ‚ÄúGo to bed, you chaos gremlin‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour screen time called. It‚Äôs ashamed.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt block apps, dim lights, or tuck you in ‚Äî it just shows up, makes noise, and hopes you listen. Genius? Maybe. Helpful? Probably not. Fun? Absolutely.
